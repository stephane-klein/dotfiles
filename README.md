## stephane-klein dotfiles powered by Chezmoi

Status: work in progress, pre-alpha

See my initial issue: https://github.com/stephane-klein/personnal-notebook/issues/25 (in French)

These dotfiles are managed using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

So far, only GNU/Linux Fedora is supported.

Upon fresh installation, the [run_once_install-fedora-packages.sh.tmpl](./run_once_install-fedora-packages.sh.tmpl) (idempotent and POSIX compliant) script would be executed once.

## What I use

- OS: Fedora 36
- Text Editor: Neovim
- Shell: zsh with oh-my-zsh
- [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) for manage Python, Node, Go, pnpm, terraformâ€¦ installation

## Getting started

### Install chezmoi and the dotfiles on any new machine

With a single command:

```sh
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsLS chezmoi.io/get)" -- init --apply stephane-klein
```
